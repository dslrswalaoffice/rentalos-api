# RentalOS — Tech Debt Register

Known, deliberate debt with a documented reconciliation path. Add an entry when
you ship a compatibility shim, a workaround, or a "leave it for now" decision —
so future work can find and retire it instead of rediscovering it as a bug.

Format per entry: **what**, **why it exists**, **where it lives**, **how to
reconcile**, **blast radius if ignored**.

## TD-1 — Order field-name convention drift (core vs Orders Module Pack)

**Status:** open · logged 2026-07-15 (Sub-slice 2.2 hotfix, PR #77) · reconcile in a later slice (3.x or a dedicated cleanup), no immediate action.

**What.** Two request-body naming conventions for the same concepts coexist in
the API:

| Concept | Core orders (older) | Orders Module Pack (2.1+) |
|---|---|---|
| Customer | `customer_person_id` | `customer_id` |
| Rental start | `rental_start` | `rental_start_at` |
| Rental end | `rental_end` | `rental_end_at` |
| Free-text note | `internal_notes` | `reason_notes` |

- **Core shape** is what every existing frontend page holds in state and sends to
  `POST /api/orders` / `PATCH /api/orders/:id`. It matches the `orders` table
  columns (`rental_start`, `rental_end`, `customer_person_id`).
- **Pack shape** is what the newer endpoints validate — it matches the newer
  tables' columns (`standbys.rental_start_at`, `standbys.customer_id`,
  `order_extensions.new_rental_end_at`, etc.).

**Why it exists.** The Pack tables were authored with `*_at` / `customer_id`
column names for clarity; their Zod schemas mirror the columns. But the shared
frontend state object (the New Order Composer) is built in the core shape for
`POST /api/orders`, so any Pack endpoint it calls from the same state is a
naming mismatch waiting to happen. It already bit us once:

- **`POST /api/standbys`** — the New Order Composer's Create Standby sent the
  core shape → HTTP 400 on every submit (production bug, PR #77).

**Where it lives / current mitigations.**
- `POST /api/orders/:id/extend` already accepts **both** `new_rental_end` and
  `new_rental_end_at` (an ad-hoc dual-accept — the first instance of this shim).
- `POST /api/standbys` now has an explicit **compatibility net**:
  `standbyCreateBodySchema` in `src/routes/standbys.ts` is a `z.preprocess`
  wrapper that maps the four core aliases onto the canonical keys before
  validating with the canonical `standbyCreateSchema` (canonical value wins if
  both are present). Covered by `test/standby_quote_contracts.test.ts`.
- The other Pack endpoints (`quote-versions` create/send/accept/withdraw,
  standby convert/release/extend, public tracking accept) take **no** customer/
  rental fields, so the drift does not reach them — no shim needed there.

**How to reconcile (future).** Pick ONE canonical request-body convention for the
API and converge:
1. Decide the winner. Recommendation: keep the core shape at the API boundary
   (`customer_person_id` / `rental_start` / `rental_end`) since it's what all
   existing clients speak and changing clients is riskier than changing the
   newer, less-used Pack schemas — OR commit to the Pack `*_at` shape everywhere
   and migrate the composer/state + `POST /api/orders`. Either is fine; pick one.
2. Update the losing side's Zod schemas (and the composer state if core loses).
3. Delete the compatibility shims: the `standbyCreateBodySchema` preprocess here
   and the `new_rental_end` dual-accept in the extend endpoint.
4. Keep the contract tests (`test/standby_quote_contracts.test.ts`) — retarget
   them at the unified shape.

**Blast radius if ignored.** Low and contained *today* (both shims accept both
shapes, so no live breakage), but every NEW Pack endpoint that takes a customer
or rental-window field is a fresh chance to reintroduce the 400 unless the author
either uses the canonical names or adds the same shim. The mitigation is the
process rule already adopted: every new endpoint ships a contract test that
parses the exact frontend payload through the endpoint's real Zod schema.

## TD-2 — `normalizeSettings` is an allow-list that silently drops unknown keys

**Status:** open · logged 2026-07-15 (Sub-slice 2.2 hotfix, PR #79) · low-risk with the current mitigation; revisit if settings keys keep growing.

**What.** `normalizeSettings()` in `src/routes/workspace.ts` (used by `GET /api/workspace` and the settings PATCH response) rebuilds a *fresh* object from a fixed allow-list of keys. Any `workspace.settings` key not explicitly copied is **dropped from the response** — even though the PATCH persists it to the JSONB and Neon shows it saved.

**Why it bit us.** The six order-policy objects (`extension_policy`, `cancellation_policy`, `approval_routing`, `notification_policy`, `standby_policy`, `quote_policy`) were **not** in the allow-list. So a saved `standby_policy.default_hold_duration_minutes = 180` could never be read back: the New Order Composer read `settings.standby_policy === undefined` and fell through to its hardcoded fallback (240). The Settings → Order Policies page appeared to work only because it kept local form state after a save and rarely re-fetched.

**Fix applied.** Added `ORDER_POLICY_SETTINGS_KEYS` — a single list that drives BOTH the GET passthrough (in `normalizeSettings`) and the PATCH merge (`ORDER_POLICY_KEYS` now aliases it) so a saved policy is always readable back. Guarded by `test/workspace_settings_roundtrip.test.ts`.

**Residual debt.** The allow-list pattern remains: **any future `settings.*` key must be added to `normalizeSettings` (and its round-trip test) or it will silently vanish on read.** This is a foot-gun for every new configurable feature.

**How to reconcile.** Either (a) switch `normalizeSettings` to *merge onto* the raw settings (fill defaults for known keys, pass everything else through) instead of rebuilding from scratch — so unknown keys survive by default; or (b) keep the allow-list but add a CI test that fails when a key present in the PATCH schema is absent from the GET passthrough. (b) is cheaper; (a) removes the foot-gun entirely.

**Blast radius if ignored.** Every new workspace-configurable setting is a chance to reintroduce the exact "saved but not readable → UI shows a hardcoded default" bug. Rule D (configurability test) catches it per-feature, but only if the author writes the test.

## TD-3 — Internal/transactional events have no email templates (silently skipped)

**Status:** open · logged 2026-07-16 (Sub-slice 2.2, PR #81) · low priority — not blocking; fold into a template-seeding sub-slice.

**What.** Several events fire correctly and create `notification_deliveries` rows, but with `status='skipped', error_message='no_template'` for the email channel, because no template is seeded under `settings.notification_policy.templates.<event>`:
- `quote_accepted_internal` (staff notification)
- `order.created`
- `extension_pending_approval` (approver notification)

So internal staff (e.g. Shoaib) don't get the emails they should when a quote is accepted, an order is created, or an approval is pending. In-product notifications for these still work; only their **email** channel is skipped.

**Not a code bug** — the pipeline behaves correctly (skip + record when no template). It's a **workspace-configuration gap**: templates were only seeded for customer-facing events (`quote_sent`, `quote_reminder`, `quote_expiring`, `quote_accepted`, `standby_expiring`, `standby_expired`) and the 2.1 order events, not for these internal ones.

**How to reconcile.** In a template-seeding sub-slice, add default email templates for the internal events above under `notification_policy.templates`, using the internal merge-field vocabulary (`order_number`, `quote_number`, `customer_name`, `total_amount`, `link_url`). Guard with the merge-field completeness audit (Rule C) so every referenced token is supplied by the emit site.

**Blast radius if ignored.** Internal staff miss email notifications (they still see in-product). No customer impact, no data loss. Distinct from the `quote_sent` bug (PR #81), which was a code bug (un-awaited emit) — a missing template writes a *skipped row*; the un-awaited emit wrote *no row at all*.
